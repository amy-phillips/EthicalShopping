# EthicalShopping
A Chrome Extension to make ethical supermarket shopping easier by colour coding products - works on Sainsburys, Tesco, Asda, Ocado, Boots and Milk&More websites so far

You can install it to your Chrome browser from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethics-in-shopping/mfbmoclfhnnhmpkclamfjpdldmamaooe

Sorry, it's kinda ugly, if you wanna volunteer to make it pretty please give me a shout!
