# EthicalShopping
A Chrome Extension to make ethical supermarket shopping easier by colour coding products - works on Sainsburys Groceries and Ocado websites so far

Early version can be found at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethics-in-shopping/mfbmoclfhnnhmpkclamfjpdldmamaooe

Sorry, it's kinda ugly, if you wanna volunteer to make it pretty please give me a shout!
